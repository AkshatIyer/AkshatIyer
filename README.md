### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Akshat Iyer! I'm a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I'm also a music minor!

I don't have a lot of time to work on my personal projects due to the sheer amount of schoolwork and clubwork that I have, so that's why I dont have too many commits
in the last couple of months.

Expect a lot more during the winter break season; I'm learning android development and am currently working on a Linktree-like app that utilizes QR codes!
